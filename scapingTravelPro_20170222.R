# update 22 Feb 2017
# my webscraping experiment for CaRdiffR, Cardiff R User Group

# my plan is to try to scrape travel information 
# the focus is on required vaccinations
# and disease risk. 

# one source of this data is http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/

# list of countries: http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/countries

# the countries are in an alphabetical list.
